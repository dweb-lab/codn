# üöÄ Codn Development Roadmap

> **Vision**: Transform codn into the ultimate toolkit for code analysis, visualization, and intelligent development workflows.

## üéØ Mission Statement

Codn aims to be the Swiss Army knife for developers, providing powerful yet simple tools for understanding, analyzing, and improving codebases at any scale. We're building the foundation for next-generation developer tools that combine static analysis, AI assistance, and interactive visualization.
